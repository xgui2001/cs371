<b>if you are ready to start this week's hw...</b>
- rename the CSCI-371 folder on your Desktop to something else
- repeat the cloning instructions below to get a new CSCI-371 folder with the files and docs for this week's hw üôÇü§ô

<b>(rare) if you haven't started last week's hw...</b>
- replace CSCI-371/hw.cpp with the file from CSCI-371/old_hw/hwX/hw.cpp

## quick start guide
i highly recommended you get the code running on your own computer, however, the only machines that we will officially support are those in the Ward Lab (TBL 301) or Unix Lab* (TCL 312). _*in the Unix Lab, only the computers with blue dots on them have GPU's_

  <summary>üêõ debugging</summary>

#### basic usage
- click to the left of a line number (red circle should appear) to toggle a breakpoint
#### troubleshooting
- **known issue -- pause button doesn't work at first in VS Code**
  - workaround: use a programmatic breakpoint `xplat_run_to_line();`
  - workaround: hit a manual breakpoint and resume, then pause should work
</details>

<details>
 <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è about the codebase</summary>
  
#### design philosophy
the CSCI-371 codebase was designed to
- compile very fast
- run fast enough
- be simple
- be small
- not require an IDE
 
#### manifest
- **cow.cpp** is a simple app library that wraps GLFW and adds some useful functionality (basic cameras, drawing, etc.)
- **snail.cpp** is an simple linalg library that may make it easier for you to work with 2-, 3-, and 4-vectors and 2x2-, 3x3-, and 4x4-matrices
- **hw.cpp** includes cow.cpp and snail.cpp, and is where you will do your homework for the week
- **ubuntu_build_and_run.sh**, **mac_build_and_run.sh**, and **windows_build_and_run.bat** compile **hw.cpp** into **executable.exe** and run it. they work on Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows respectively
- **xplat_debug_vscode.bat** is a cross-platform script that should, fingers crossed, open VS Code and start debugging **executable.exe**

#### fun facts
- the codebase is using a [unity build](https://hero.handmade.network/forums/code-discussion/t/2651-unity_builds_in_practice) (smoosh everything into one file and compile it; no incremental building; no relation to the game engine)

 <summary>üéâ C/C++ fun facts</summary>

```c
// // stack-allocated fixed-size arrays

// stack-allocated fixed-size array of 16 doubles filled with garbage
double a[16];

// same thing but filled with zeroes
double a[16] = {}; 

// these three lines are equivalent
double a[3] = { 0, 0, 0 };
double a[3] = {};
double a[] = { 0, 0, 0 };

// consider a function foo that takes a pointer to a double
void foo(double *bar);
// if we call foo on a fixed size array bar, then inside the body of foo
// the argument bar will no longer be a fixed size array
// it will have "decayed into a pointer"
```

```c
// // heap-allocated arrays

// b is a pointer to heap-allocated array of 1000 doubles filled with garbage
double *b = (double *) malloc(1000 * sizeof(double));

// same thing but filled with zeroes
double *b = (double *) calloc(1000, sizeof(double));
// ^ equivalent to calling malloc as above and then calling
// memset(b, 0, 1000 * sizeof(double));       
```

```c
// // structs

// this is a struct containing two doubles followed by two ints followed by a pointer to a Poe    
struct Poe {                                                                               
    double x, y;                                                                             
    int i, j;                                                                              
    Poe *twin;                                                                             
};                                                                                         

// stack-allocated struct of type Poe filled with garbage
Poe poe;

// same thing but filled with zeroes
Poe poe = {};
// for the example struct, this is equivalent to Poe poe = { 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, NULL };          
// which we can also write as Poe poe = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 } without the compiler complaining    

// stack-allocated fixed-size array of 5 Poe's filled with zeroes
Poe poes[5] = {};

// pointer to a heap-allocated array of 9999 Poe's filled with garbage
Poe *poes = malloc(9999 * sizeof(Poe));

// you can partially intialize an array or struct (unspecified arguments filled with zeros)  
// e.g. Poe poe = { 3.14, -4.2, 1 }; is the same as Poe poe = { 3.14, -4.2, 1, 0, NULL };    

// the journey continues...                                     
Poe poe_array[4] = { { 1.3, 0, 5 }, {}, { .2, .4, 1, 3 } };
```

```c
// // white space

void purple (int *cow) {               
     *cow += 5;                        
}                                      
                                       
// is the same as                         
                                       
void purple(int*cow){*cow+=5;}         
                                       
// is the same as                         
                                       
void                                   
   purple      (int                    
* cow) {                               
  *                                    
cow += 5     ;              }          
```

```c
// // struct / class basics

// both the . and the -> let me access the fields of a struct/class
// .  is when we have the thing                                    
// -> is when we have a pointer to the thing                       
// rule of thumb: pass by pointer when we need to modify the thing 
// (e.g. sbuff_push_back)
